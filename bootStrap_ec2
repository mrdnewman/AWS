$ sudo sudo hostnamectl set-hostname tf-ctl01

$ sudo sed -i "/127.0.0.1 localhost/a\\127.0.0.1 tf-ctl01" /etc/hosts

  So in this case, when we match a line with /127.0.0.1 localhost/, we run the 
  command APPEND ->'a' -> with text argument "'127.0.0.1 tf-ctl01'", which becomes 
  a new line of the file:

$ sudo init 6
